					<b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site" target="_blank">Web site</a>
					for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">Internet</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">World Wide Web</a>)
					or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet" target="_blank">intranet</a> (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Web_page" target="_blank">static page</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Web_page" target="_blank">plain text</a> to complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" target="_blank">web applications,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_business" target="_blank">electronic businesses,</a>
					and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service" target="_blank">social network services.</a>
					A more comprehensive list
					of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_engineering" target="_blank">Web engineering,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Web design,</a> 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Web content development,</a>
					client liaison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">client-side</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">server-side scripting</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Web server and</a> 
					<a href="" target="_blank">network security</a> configuration, and <a href="" target="_blank">e-commerce</a>
					development.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: 
					writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">markup</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">coding</a>.[2] Web development may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">content management systems</a> (CMS) to make content changes 
					easier and available with basic technical skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design">Web developers</a>) 
					and follow standard methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only 
					require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">graphic designer</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">information systems</a> technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments 
					rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">front-end 
					developer</a>, back-end developer, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">full-stack developer</a>. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals 
					that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.

				<h2>As an industry</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">commercialization of the Web</a>, Web development has been a growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design"target="_blank">industry</a>. 
					The growth of this industry is 
					being driven by businesses wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell products and services to customers.[3]
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design"target="_blank">open source</a> tools for Web development such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">BerkeleyDB</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design"target="_blank">GlassFish</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">LAMP</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Linux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Apache</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">PHP</a>) 
					stack and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Perl/Plack</a>. This has kept the cost of learning Web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to 
					the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a> Web-development software, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Adobe Dreamweaver</a>, 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design"target="_blank">BlueGriffon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>. Knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">HyperText Markup Language</a> (HTML) or of programming languages is 
					still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
					An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive Web sites. 
					Further, Web developers now help to deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally only available as 
					applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media 
					distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">cloud</a> services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Adobe Creative Cloud</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Google 
					Drive</a>. These Web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a 
					specific workstation for their application environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by Web development include e-commerce. Online 
					auction sites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">eBay</a> have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such 
					as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Buy.com</a> (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many 
					consumers. Another example of transformative communication led by Web development is the <a href="" target="_blank">blog</a>. Web applications such as 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Movable Type</a> have created blog-environments for individual Web sites. The increased usage of open-source 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">content management systems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">enterprise content management</a> systems has extended Web development's impact at online 
					interaction and communication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing. Web sites are no longer simply tools for work or 
					for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">commerce</a>, but serve more broadly for communication and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">social networking</a>. Web sites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Twitter</a>					
					provide users with a platform to communicate and organizations with a more personal and interactive way to engage the 
					public.

				<dd><i>Main article:</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Software testing</a></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
			Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified 
			requirements or not. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to 
			the actual requirements. The extent of testing varies greatly between organizations, developers, and individual sites or 
			applications.

			<h2>Security considerations</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
			<i>Web development</i> takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking through forms, filtering 
			output, and encryption. Malicious practices such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">SQL injection</a> can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only 
			primitive knowledge of Web development as a whole. Scripts can be used to exploit Web sites by granting unauthorized access to 
			malicious users that try to collect information such as email addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card 
			numbers. Some of this is dependent on the server environment on which the scripting language, such as <a href="" target="_blank">ASP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">JSP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">PHP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Python</a>, 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Perl</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Ruby</a> is running, and therefore is not necessarily down to the Web developer themselves to maintain. However, stringent 
			testing of Web applications before public release is encouraged to prevent such exploits from occurring. If some contact form is
			provided on a Web site it should include a captcha field in it which prevents computer programs from automatically filling forms 
			and also mail spamming.
			Because new security holes are found in Web applications even after testing and launch, security patch updates are frequent for 
			widely used applications. It is often the job of Web developers to keep applications up to date as security patches are released 
			and new security concerns are discovered.
			Keeping a Web server safe from intrusion is often called Server Port Hardening. Many technologies come into play to keep 
			information on the Internet safe when it is transmitted from one location to another. For instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">TLS certificates</a> 
			(or "SSL certificates") are issued by certificate authorities to help prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">Internet fraud</a>. Many developers often employ 
			different forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">encryption</a> when transmitting and storing sensitive information. A basic understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" target="_blank">information 
			technology</a> security concerns is often part of a Web developer's knowledge.
