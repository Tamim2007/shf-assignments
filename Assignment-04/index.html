					<h1>Ghostbusters Afterlife Reaction</h1>
					<p>
						Set in the universe of the first two Ivan Reitman films from the 1980s, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” tells the story of Callie, a 
						single mom struggling to survive in Chicago with her two kids, 12-year-old Phoebe and 15-year-old Trevor. When Callie receives news of her 
						long-estranged father’s passing – a father she never even knew – she and the kids pack up the Subaru and move to ...

					<h1>Dreams on top of dreams inside dreams</h1>
					<p>
						It's said that Christopher Nolan spent ten years writing his screenplay for "Inception." That must have involved prodigious 
						concentration, like playing blindfold chess while walking a tight-wire. The film's hero tests a young architect by challenging her 
						to create a maze, and Nolan tests us with his own dazzling maze. We have to trust him that he can lead us through, because ...

					<h1>Review: What I Loved About Stranger Things 3 (And What I Didn't)</h1>
					<p>
						Hi there! It's been a while since I've blogged about books. It's been a while since I blogged, period. I wasn't going to write a 
						review of a TV show, but then I realized this is my blog, and I can post about whatever I want. If I'm going to take the time to sit 
						down and write about something, it might as well be something that makes me ...

					<h1>Enola Holmes</h1>
					<p>
						It's been a while since a Netflix film prompted me to write in my cinephile What's App group chat: "ok everybody, I have a fun movie 
						to suggest." After the boring disappointments of The Devil All the Time and Project Power, after the unspeakable horrors I witnessed 
						in The Last Days of American Crime, I confess I log in my Netflix account holding my breath. Enola ...

					<h1>Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl</h1>
					<p>
						There's a nice little 90-minute B movie trapped inside the 143 minutes of "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," a 
						movie that charms the audience and then outstays its welcome. Although the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the movie 
						feels like it ...
